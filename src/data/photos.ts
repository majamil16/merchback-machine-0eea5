/**
 * Photographs on loan.
 *
 * A record shows a real photograph the moment there is one to show; otherwise it falls
 * back to the drawn plate, clearly marked as a drawing. To accession a photo:
 *
 *   1. Drop the file in `public/plates/`, named after the artifact id.
 *   2. Add one entry to PHOTOS below, keyed by that same id.
 *
 * `credit` prints under the image, `creditUrl` links back to where it came from, and
 * `note` is for the honest caveat: a photo of the current production run standing in
 * for an older original, a colourway that differs, a stand-in object.
